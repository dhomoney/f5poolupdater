F5 Pool Updater

The F5 Pool Updater was built out of a work project that had me doing performance testing. I would frequently have to
add a ton of servers to the pools and then tear it back down, rinse and repeat. This tool was built because having to do
this manually in the GUI or the CLI was a slog and took forever. The secondary focus of this was to learn both Python
and the F5 Python SDK. I hope you fine this useful.

Usage:

'python f5poolupdater.py <Action> <Pool Name> <Starting IP Address> <Number of Addresses> <Port> <CIDR Netmask>'

Actions:

-a
   Add. Tells the program you are adding members to the pool

-d
   Delete. Tells the program you are deleting members from the pool

Options:

Pool Name
   This tells the program what the name of the pool you are changing is named. Currently this version assumes the
   Common partition. If you are removing members, this is the only option needed.

Starting IP Address
   This option is the dotted quad of the first IP address you are putting in the pool. Currently the program does not
   support IPv6 addresses.

Number of Addresses
   This option tells the program the number of contiguous addresses to add.

Port
   This option tells the program what TCP/UDP port the member is listening on. All members have to have the same port.

CIDR Netmask
   This tells the program the number of addresses in the subnet of the servers. This is used to validate IP addresses.

Versions:

0.1a - Initial release. Missing some key features, such as deletion.

0.1b - Added deletion and better argument handling
